Steps to execute Haar Feature Project:
*Step-1: Object Marking*
- First you need data which are images(.bmp), if not Download any video which should be short, good quality and have feature or
  object that you want to detect. like this one e.g https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNn9qKG2UFI&list=PLcQZGj9lFR7y5WikozDSrdk6UCtAnM9mB
- Than will need images frames from video, Use python or any script that gives you image frames in .bpm formate. 
  Use Convert-video-into-frames.ipynb script and add your video path, folder name.
- After extracted .bmp images suppose these are the possitive images (hint: don't use more images just 20 images are fine).
- Other than all images are negative so use any randome images and suppose those negative feature images.
- Go to *\temp\positive\rawdata* and replace positive images
- Go to *\temp\negative* and replace negative images
- Run *create_list.bat* in folder *\temp\negative* to create a file with a list of negative image names
- Go to *\temp\positive* and run *objectmarker.bat* and mark your required objects
- Press Space to save marked object, enter to change image and ESC to save and end marking
- After object marking it will create *info.txt* in folder *\temp\positive*
 *Step-2: Sample Creation*
- Go to root folder edit *samples_creation.bat* file. Change input file name (if required), output filename, width and height of the samples
- Run *samples_creation.bat* file. It will create a vector file in folder *\temp\data* with a name you gave to output file in *samples_creation.bat* file.
 *Step-3: Compute feature and Training*
- Open *haarTraining.bat* file in root folder. Change your vector file name, width and height of samples
- Run *haarTraining.bat* . It will compute features and train the model. The model will be saved in folder *\temp\data\cascade*
 *Step 4: Convert Model to XML*
- Copy all folders from *\temp\data\cascade* and paste in *\cascade2xml\data*
- Edit *convert.bat* in folder *\cascade2xml*. Change output xml file name, width and height
- Run *\cascade2xml.bat*, it will create xml file in the same folder
 *Step 5: Test Model*
- Copy your xml file and paste in *\test_recognition* and add your test image in the same folder
- Edit *start.bat*,  add a line at the top *facedetect.exe --cascade="YOUR_XML_MODEL_FILE.xml" YOUR_TEST_IMAGE.jpg*
- Run *start.bat* to see the results
